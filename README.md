# Vehicle-Model-Sales-Analysis-in-SQLite

## Introduction
Data analysis has proven to be highly effective in the realm of sales. It allows us to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) that help us make better decisions, saving us time, resources, and money.
Sales data analysis covers various aspects such as sales, production, customer experience, and employee efficiency. As a result, it presents several challenges. 

In this project, I analyzed data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract valuable information for decision-making.

## Tables in the Database
The car database consists of 8 tables namely;
ProductLines: This is a list of the product line categories
Customers: It consists of all the customer data
Employees: This table stores all the information relating to the employees
Offices: Sales offices information are here
Orders: This contains the customerâ€™s sales order
OrderDetails: sales order line for each sales order
Payments: customers' payment records
Products: a list of scale model cars

## Conclusion
With the aid of data analysis we have been able to answer some very pertinent questions for this car store. The insights gotten from this analysis will enable decision makers to target customers better and increase their profit.
